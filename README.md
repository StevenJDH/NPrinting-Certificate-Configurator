# NPrinting Certificate Configurator
This program is used to automatically install and configure Qlik NPrinting with a CA signed certificate automatically. There are various steps needed to do this manually, including converting the certificate to the correct format with OpenSSL, but these steps and or folder locations will vary depending on the version you use. NPrinting Certificate Configurator takes care of these error-prone steps with a click of a button.
